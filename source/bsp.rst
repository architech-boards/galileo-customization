The Board Support Package is composed by a set files, patches, recipes, configuration files, etc.
This chapter gives you the information you need when you want to customize something, fix a bug,
or simply learn how the all thing has been assembled.

Build from bitbake
------------------

The most frequent way of customization of the Linux Kernel is to change the .config file that contains the Kernel options. Setup the environment and run:

.. host::

 | bitbake virtual/kernel -c cleanall
 | bitbake virtual/kernel -c menuconfig

a new window, like the following one, will pop-up:

.. image:: _static/menuconfig.png

follow the instructions, save and exit, than you ready to generate your preferred image based on your customized kernel. If you prefer, you can build just the kernel running:

.. host::

 | bitbake virtual/kernel

At the end of the build process, the output file (bzImage), along with the built kernel modules, will be placed under *tmp/deploy/images/@machine-name@/* inside your build directory, so, if you are building your system from the default directory, the destination directory will be */home/@user@/architech_sdk/architech/@board-alias@/yocto/meta-clanton_v1.0.1/yocto_build/tmp/deploy/images/*.
